# 🛰️ ISRO Satellite Orbit Tracker

An interactive web-based satellite orbit simulation tool built to visualize and understand the motion of satellites around Earth using real orbital mechanics. This project dynamically calculates and displays core orbital parameters and simulates satellite movement along a 2D visual orbit path in real time.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **ISRO Satellite Orbit Tracker** allows users to explore how satellites move around Earth by adjusting key orbital parameters such as altitude, inclination, and eccentricity. The tool provides **live tracking** of a satellite's position, including real-time calculation of:

- 🌍 Latitude & Longitude  
- 📏 Altitude  
- 🎯 Apogee & Perigee  
- ⏱️ Orbital Period  
- ⚡ Orbital Velocity  
- 🛰️ Ground Track Shift  

The tracker also includes a built-in ISRO Mission Database with preloaded orbital configurations for major ISRO satellites, enabling quick one-click simulations.
